# My-portfolio

### I have created portfolio, which contains my personal information, my skills and experiences, in addition to the certificates that I have taken, and my accounts on social media sites.

### At first I created a sketch using figma to draw a wireframe and mockup screen which represent the website.

### I have designed each section separately to be more clear and to make it easier to understand how to navigate in the portfolio.

### Here is a link for Wireframe [Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/ygCxeozo6oMfATVnemsCln/Untitled?node-id=5%3A55&t=uf8JQNVcoRfJQP0V-0) .

### Here is a link for mockup [Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/ygCxeozo6oMfATVnemsCln/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=uf8JQNVcoRfJQP0V-0) .


### And this is the link to the GitHub repository, where you can see the code for the portfolio [My-portfolio](https://github.com/razan-aboushi/My-portfolio).




### I used the following tools to complete this work:

+ Visual Studio code to write the codes.
+ HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language).
+ CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheet) version 3 .
+ Bootstrap framwork.
+ Java Script To make the site more responsive to different sizes of screens and devices "Navbar".
+ Figma to create Wireframe and Mockup screens.
+ Git and Github.
